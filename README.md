# Historic Car Sales in Canada
This study investigated the dramatic decrease of Canadian automobile sales in the early 1980s. It was found that unemployment and inflation rates were significantly correlated to vehicle sales. Interstingly, the skyrocketing price of oil was not correlated to sales, but could be a reason why unemployment and inflation were so high.
