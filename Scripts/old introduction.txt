# 1.0 Introduction
TRIM INTRO, ADD WHY ITS IMPORTANT.
## 1.1 History of the Automobile Industry in Canada 

|       Canada has a rich automotive history that is deeply connected to its economy. Between the first Canadian automobile produced in 1867 and the early United States (US) imports in 1898 (@CDNauto), Canada has been a player in the global market from the beginning. Canada welcomed the creation of Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd in 1904, and by 1913, had roughly 50,000 vehicles on Canadian roads (@CDNauto). In the early 1920s, Canada had strengthened its hold on the market and was the second largest producer of vehicles in the world (@cvmaHistory). 

|       Nowadays, Canada is still a significant competitor in the automobile market. However, it is not the behemoth it once was. Canada is the 8th largest automobile producer globally and is the third largest exporter after Japan and the US (@CDNauto). Canada is home to many different manufacturing plants, such as Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Honda, and Fiat-Chrysler (@CarsMadeInCan). These plants make massive contributions to Canada’s manufacturing sector, representing 12% of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) and 24% of manufacturing trade (@CDNauto). The industry itself employs roughly 130,000 people, mostly located in Ontario, and indirectly employs another 370,000 (@cvmaFacts).

|       Canadians (and the Canadian economy) are dependent on automobiles. Every year, Canada exports \$65 billion worth of vehicles and $30 billion worth of parts (@CDNauto). The entire country has been built around the automobile, with cities being designed around roads, highways, and parking lots. There are currently over 35 million registered vehicles in Canada (@statsCan), nearly one registered car for every Canadian. Clearly, the automotive industry is a cornerstone in the Canadian economy. 

|       Although 80% of cars produced in Canada are exported (@CDNauto), the high ratio of cars to people means domestic sales still make significant contributions to the economy. Since the beginning, there has been consistent growth in national sales for the Canadian automobile industry – with a few exceptions (@newVehicleSales). In the early 1980s, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of new vehicles sold in Canada (@newVehicleSales). There are many factors that affect the number of vehicles sold in a country, but this paper will argue that high oil prices, unemployment rates, and inflation were related to the dramatic decrease of Canadian automobile sales during the early 1980s.

## 1.2 Important Events in the 1970s and 1980s 

|       The 1970s were a period that saw 2 significant oil crises, the second of which contributed to a global recession (@GlobalRecessions). After World War II, the Allied powers created the state of Israel in the Middle East. Since then, there have been numerous wars between the Arabic and Israeli people. One of these wars was the Yom-Kippur War. It began in 1973 when Egypt and Syria launched an attack on Israel (@HistoryChannel). The Soviet-Union supported Egypt and Syria and the US backed Israel (@HistoryChannel). As an act of retaliation, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) significantly reduced their oil production and created an oil embargo on the US (@HistoryChannel). This ban on trade and reduced production dramatically affected the price of oil, from \$2.70 USD per barrel in 1973 to $11.00 in 1974 (@oilPrices). This increase in price was felt globally and was enough to send countries not directly affected by the embargo into an energy crisis (@HistoryChannel). Although the trade ban was lifted in 1974, the price of oil stayed relatively high and did not fall back to pre-embargo levels (@oilPrices).

|       In 1979, the second dramatic increase in the price of oil occurred. The Iranian Revolution started in 1978 and ended in 1979 with the Shah of Iran being ousted by Ayatollah Khomeini (@AutomotiveNews, @Investopedia). Khomeini drastically reduced oil production, which reduced global shipments of crude oil (@AutomotiveNews). Due to the reduced supply, gasoline prices skyrocketed. Prices more than doubled from 1978 - 1979, from \$12.79 USD per barrel to $29.19 (@oilPrices).

|       Partly because of the dramatic increase in the price of oil, Canada was plunged into a deep recession during the early 1980s. The Iranian Revolution, paired with new monetary policy, led to a sharp decline in US production and an increase in unemployment rates (@GlobalRecessions). Since the US and Canadian economies were so tightly linked, Canadians felt the impact of the US’ decreased production and saw a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate as well. In 1981, unemployment was at 7.6%, but by 1982, this number had jumped to 11.0% (@UnemploymentCan). As the CBC said, “If they’re not building homes in Boston, they’re not cutting timber in BC” (@CBC). The increase in price of oil and new monetary policy eventually led to increasing rates of inflation around the world – including Canada (@GlobalRecessions, @inflation). Currently, the Bank of Canada tries to keep inflation between 1 and 3% (@BOC). In the early 1980s, inflation was at just over 12% (@inflation). Combining the high inflation rate with a high unemployment rate meant Canadians were having difficulty purchasing groceries, heating their homes, and financing significant life events (@CBC). Without money for food, it is unlikely that many Canadians were considering purchasing new automobiles at this time. 

|       During the 1970s and early 1980s, domestic gas-guzzlers were the most popular car on the market (@AutomotiveNews). Smaller and more fuel-efficient Japanese cars were just starting to gain traction (@AutomotiveNews). Because favourite automobiles used a lot of gas, the price of gas was skyrocketing, inflation rates were increasing, and people could not find jobs, “consumer confidence evaporated” (@AutomotiveNews), and automobile sales were decimated in the early 1980s.

## 1.3 Structure of paper and method of analysis

|       This paper will try to confirm the research above using datasets provided by various sources, which are discussed in the next section. A surface level investigation into Canadian automobile sales, world oil prices, unemployment rates, and inflation levels will be done next. After, four regression discontinuity design (RDD) models will be constructed to observe the dip in sales during the early 1980s. Three separate linear regression models will then be constructed with vehicle sales as the dependent variable and oil prices, unemployment rate, and inflation rate used as the independent variables. A multiple linear regression model will also be created. The paper will then discuss results, key findings, ethics, weaknesses, and some next steps. Although this study looks to draw a link between vehicle sales, oil prices, unemployment rates, and inflation, it will not be able to speak to causality of the dramatic decrease in automobile sales during the early 1980s. The reasoning behind why causality cannot be determined will be talked about in the discussion section, after key findings.
