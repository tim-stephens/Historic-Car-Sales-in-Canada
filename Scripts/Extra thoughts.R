#possible reason why oil prices are correlated (+) with auto sales: 

#A possible explanation for this correlation is as follows: as more Canadians 
#buy cars, cities and towns are developed around the assumption that one will 
#own a vehicle. Towns become more spread out, cities are built around roads, 
#and soon, it is essential for one to own an automobile. Since a car is now a
#necessity, and a car runs on gas, oil producers can raise the price of oil, 
#knowing that Canadians will have to fork out the extra cash to keep their car
#running. As cities continue develop, more Canadians buy cars, and the cycle
#continues. Looking at Figures 3 and 4, it is clear that both car sales and oil
#prices increase over time. 

# This correlation makes sense on the larger scale, but not in the time frame the 
# study was inspecting. Perhaps long term, oil prices and car sales are positively 
# correlated, and the early 1980s was an anomaly.
